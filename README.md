# Cyno: Agentic AI-Assisted Astro Buddy

Cyno is an intelligent assistant and companion designed to help you explore the wonders of the cosmos. Leveraging Agentic AI capabilities, Cyno acts as your personal astro buddy—answering your space-related questions, guiding stargazing sessions, and providing insights tailored to your curiosity.

## 🚀 Project Vision

- **Personalized Astronomy Assistant:** Cyno can help with celestial navigation, space factoids, and live updates on astronomical events.
- **Conversational & Agentic:** Interact in natural language and let Cyno proactively suggest observations, events, or cosmic phenomena based on your interests.
- **Learning & Exploration:** Explore curated space articles, get recommendations for observing the night sky, or even simulate cosmic journeys.
- **Integrations:** (Planned) Hook into APIs for real-time data (NASA, ESA, skywatching apps).

## 🧑‍🚀 Features (Planned)

- AI-powered Q&A on astronomy topics
- Event notifications for eclipses, meteor showers, etc.
- Interactive night sky maps and guides
- Fun facts and trivia about planets, stars, and galaxies
- Personalized learning journeys in astronomy
